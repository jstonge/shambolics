cdonov12@uvm.edu (R_1Iud8jqUOwnZfGP): Hello Jonathan! There were a couple of questions about citing someone else's code that didn't provide a option for not having used someone else's code. Rather, there were two options for not having cited someone else's code. Also, there was a likert or ranking scale that I don't remember the topic of anymore, but it was worded such that I almost put in the opposite responses that I intended. I think some of the options were "Very important to not have" or some such and they could be clarified. Hope all goes well out there

chryan@uvm.edu (R_1pldwkTdQf0RCMV): I was slightly confused by the "how important do you think the following items are in academia" question, but it became more clear after rereading it a couple times. Maybe try to reword the question and/or the options?
lpitawal@uvm.edu (R_2uPRPyOeMANpcpo): The statements to the question, 'How important do you think the following about coding are.....' were a little bit confusing for me. Maybe it was how it was phrased. When I read the question and the statement together I felt a bit confused. Other than that, great survey! :)
sfrosenb@uvm.edu (R_1Ime9cZdUYEBSh2): The questions which included "somewhat important not to have" options were confusing

aontiver@uvm.edu (R_WCcpDWT3a5yC2tz): Under the section that says "course-work aside,..." there should be an option that says something like "I only code for course work" or "with the amount of time I spend coding for course work, I dont want to do any of these things outside of that time"
kathryn.cramer@uvm.edu (R_1gMb3cQHTaJRHvr): You should add a question in which the user can specify what under-represented group they think they belong to.
