- `Abstracts and pdf parsed` shows the total number of papers and the number of papers for which either the abstract or pdf is parsed. 
- `s2fos v. mag` is a showdown between the semantic scholar classification scheme and the microsoft academic graph one. Papers are grouped by fields and year, and we keep track of the parsing extent for each.

### Remarks
 - Biology is an encompassing field. I wish we could divide it further.
 - In my opinion the biggest difference beween `mag`and `s2fos` schema is that the later track the emergerce of computer science, which is nice.

### Notes

Classifying articles into fields is non-trivial. But at least there is work on the topic. 

For a while, the [microsoft academic graph (mag)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/) was standard. Many researchers used the [top mag fields of study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/articles/expanding-concept-understanding-in-microsoft-academic-graph/) as their main taxonomy. Now that the mag project at microsoft is deprecated (Dec. 31, 2021.; see [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/articles/microsoft-academic-to-expand-horizons-with-community-driven-approach/)), AllenAI's semantic scholar is arguably one of the best contender to become the next standard. Contrary to MAG, they provide a unified api for the citation graphs of papers and they released a fraction of their overall paper nodes as parsed text. [Announced after mag deprecation](https://blog.allenai.org/announcing-s2fos-an-open-source-academic-field-of-study-classifier-9d2f641949e5), the semantic scholar databse did some more work on the classification scheme, which can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/s2_fos). This is what we use and compare here, as did other before us.

We note that all the current schemes agree that papers have overlapping fields and are hierarchical. This is something that the mag field made explicit through the use of a hierarhical algorithm for unsupervised topic classification. The `s2_fos` scheme drops the hierarchy and focus on the top fields using a (simpler) classifier.
